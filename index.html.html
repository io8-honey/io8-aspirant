    <p>
      It is said that in Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, no man may
      kill a cat; and this I can verily believe as I gaze upon him who sitteth
      purring before the fire. For the cat is cryptic, and close to strange
      things which men cannot see. He is the soul of antique Aegyptus, and
      bearer of tales from forgotten cities in Meroe and Ophir. He is the kin of
      the jungles lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa.
      The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more
      ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten.

      In Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there
      dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats
      of their neighbors. Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the
      voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run
      stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight. But whatever the reason,
      this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat
      which came near to their hovel; and from some of the sounds heard after
      dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly
      peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man
      and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of
      the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under
      spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard. In truth, much as the
      owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of
      berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet
      or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When
      through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard
      after dark, the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by
      thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished.
      For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats
      first came.

      There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother,
      but only a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not been kind to
      him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow; and
      when one is very young, one can find great relief in the lively antics of
      a black kitten. So the boy whom the dark people called Menes smiled more
      often than he wept as he sat playing with his graceful kitten on the steps
      of an oddly painted wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third morning of the wanderers stay in Ulthar, Menes could not find
      his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market-place certain villagers
      told him of the old man and his wife, and of sounds heard in the night.
      And when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation, and
      finally to prayer. He stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in
      a tongue no villager could understand; though indeed the villagers did not
      try very hard to understand, since their attention was mostly taken up by
      the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming. It was very peculiar,
      but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead
      the shadowy, nebulous figures of exotic things; of hybrid creatures
      crowned with horn-flanked disks. Nature is full of such illusions to
      impress the imaginative.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the wanderers left Ulthar, and were never seen again. And the
      householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there
      was not a cat to be found. From each hearth the familiar cat had vanished;
      cats large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow and white. Old Kranon,
      the burgomaster, swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in
      revenge for the killing of Menes kitten; and cursed the caravan and the
      little boy. But Nith, the lean notary, declared that the old cotter and
      his wife were more likely persons to suspect; for their hatred of cats was
      notorious and increasingly bold. Still, no one durst complain to the
      sinister couple; even when little Atal, the innkeepers son, vowed that he
      had at twilight seen all the cats of Ulthar in that accursed yard under
      the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage,
      two abreast, as if in performance of some unheard-of rite of beasts. The
      villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though
      they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they
      preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark
      and repellent yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people awakened at
      dawnbehold! every cat was back at his accustomed hearth! Large and small,
      black, grey, striped, yellow and white, none was missing. Very sleek and
      fat did the cats appear, and sonorous with purring content. The citizens
      talked with one another of the affair, and marveled not a little. Old
      Kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them, since
      cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man .and his
      wife. But all agreed on one thing: that the refusal of all the cats to eat
      their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly
      curious. And for two whole days the sleek, lazy cats of Ulthar would touch
      no food, but only doze by the fire or in the sun.

      And in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of
      by traders in Hatheg and discussed by travelers in Nir; namely, that in
      Ulthar no man may kill a cat.
